    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe objective of this project is to explore the intricate relationship between tourism and economic indicators and climate conditions. We begin the exploration by assessing the significance of tourism in each country by examining domestic, inbound and outbound tourism coupled with tourist expenditure for each of these categories. Once we understand trends in global tourism, our focus shifts to how tourism factors into global economies.\nTourism plays a pivotal role in many countries, especially in those with tropical climates. For example, in 2019, it was reported that tourism contributed to over 30% of the GDP for Macau, Maldives and Aruba. In studying how travel factors into GDP globally, we aim to identify seasonal and geographical trends. This includes the impact of significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the global travel economy. We also hope to discern emerging travel corridors resulting from re-opening borders or economic stimulation. Our investigation also extends to metrics such as employment, which are also markers of economic health for the tourism industry.\nThe surge of large climate events such as heat waves, floods and forest fires around the world, also prompts us to consider how tourism and climate are intertwined. In examining air travel alone, we can observe the carbon footprint of travel. We’re also interested in understanding how natural disasters and evolving climate conditions may have affected popular tourist destinations.\nLastly, we are interested in examining concurrent trends in happiness and tourism across countries. Powered by the Gallup World Surveys, the data from the World Happiness Report contains metrics such as Social Support, Healthy Life, and Perceptions of Corruption to get a holistic view of population happiness in a given country. The dataset also maps the happiness metrics to GDP per capita, which we plan to leverage as well. By exploring this data, we hope to understand whether any of the factors influencing population happiness could also affect tourism levels. It’s also possible that tourism levels impact over population happiness of a country, which makes this an interesting relationship to study. We hope to get a preliminary idea of whether population happiness and tourism could be intertwined in any way.\nOur motivation for choosing this topic stems from our interest in exploring geography. The study of tourism metrics aligns well with geography, as we can easily identify regional differences and global, cyclical trends. The steep decline in travel during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic spurred our curiosity about the resurgence of the tourism. To this end, we want to understand whether economic and climate conditions are conducive to tourism and vice-versa."

    "text": "3.1 Technical Description\nFor our project, we will use data on global tourism and related variables and indicators to study the effect tourism has on countries around the world. The main tourism-specific data that we will be using comes from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We will draw data from their “Tourism Statistics Database”, from which we will use five tables containing tourism indicators for each country. The tables have data for Inbound Tourism, Domestic Tourism, Outbound Tourism, Tourism Industries, and Employment. Inbound, Domestic, and Outbound Tourism tables have data on arrivals, accommodation, expenditure, and departures. We will focus on inbound arrivals and employment. The data provides indicators by country, with values (in thousands) for each indicator from 1995-2022. Countries are listed in the same column as the indicators, with the same indicators for each country following in the rows after the country name. Therefore, to make this data useful for graphing, we will need to do quite a bit of engineering to organize indicators. The data is collected yearly from countries by the UNWTO, with the most recent data update taking place October 2023. However, our data is yearly and thus only goes until 2022, since the full data for 2023 is not yet available. Further, the data requires that each individual country accurately and routinely tracks tourism data and then reports it to the United Nations, and thus there is a large amount of missing data for many countries, especially in earlier years. In fact, the UN did not outline their International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics (IRTS 2008) until 2008, and the World Tourism Organization only became an agency of the UN in 2004, so data was not as regulated before these years.\nTo study the effects that tourism has on the economy, climate, and happiness, we will use supplemental data. For economic factors, we will study employment from the UNWTO data, and will also use data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to analyze the relationship between tourism and GDP. The data is a simple table where rows are countries, columns are the years from 1980 to 2028, with data from 2023 to 2028 being projected values.The values in the table represent actual GDP values for each country and year. The data comes from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook report, which is updated yearly. The data mapper from which we are pulling data only includes some indicators from the entire report. Data is collected as accurately as possible by IMF employees, and historical data is updated as more information becomes available. Though the employees of IMF gather data as meticulously as possible, of course there are still gaps. Similarly to tourism data, much of the data is missing in earlier years. Our downloaded data was updated October 2023.\nOur climate data also comes from the International Monetary Fund, from their Climate Change Dashboard, which offers global data on many climate change indicators. We will be studying Climate-related Disasters data. This data is organized similarly to the GDP data, with rows being for countries and columns for years 1980-2022. The values in the table indicate the number of climate-related disasters that occurred in each country for each year. Each country has multiple rows, since for each there is a row for drought, temperature, flood, wildfire, storm, landslide, and total. The data was last updated in April 2023, but data is updated when there is availability of new indicators or methodology, which does not have a set schedule. Again, similar to GDP, data is collected and released by IMF employees to the best of their ability.\nFinally, we will use happiness data from the World Happiness Report, which gathers data from the Gallup World Poll surveys from 2020 to 2022. Unfortunately, the average sample size from the poll is 1,000 people per country, and thus the data is far from conclusive. However, the data offers multiple “happiness indicators” from the poll for any participating countries. Some examples are Social support data, a Healthy Life score, a value for “Freedom to make life choices”, and more. Data is quantitative, using an average score from the Gallup poll. The report has been released most years since 2012, but we will focus on the most recent report, with data from the 2023 Gallup poll.\nFor all data, we will download excel or csv files and read them as data frames. The indicator data (economy, climate, happiness) will not need much engineering beyond missing values. UNWTO data will need to be pivoted. Then, data will be joined by country name to conduct our analysis and create graphs."

    "text": "3.2 Research Plan\nBased on our multi-faceted approach to understanding tourism, we plan to use the following data sources to answer our research questions:\nTourism by Country:\n\nUNWTO Statistics: https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/key-tourism-statistics\n\nThis dataset contains information on inbound, domestic and outbound tourism for countries around the world\nFor inbound tourism, UNWTO provides data on travel purpose, mode of transportation, traveler accommodations, and tourism expenditure\nThe dataset also contains expenditure information for domestic and outbound travels\nWe will use this data to identify trends in inbound travel across countries and larger regions. Visualizing the inbound expenditures data, especially, enables us to understand how much tourists contribute to local economies at a high level\n\n\nTourism and the Economy:\n\nIMF GDP Growth: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD\nThis dataset captures the actual GDP value (in billions) for all countries from 1980 through 2023, with predictions until 2028. We can use the dataset to identify the overall trend in GDP across countries, as a baseline for understanding how tourism may factor into it.\n\nWe envision plotting this data to study how tourism effects GDP and whether richer countries see more tourism.\n\nStatista Travel GDP Contributions: https://www.statista.com/statistics/233223/travel-and-tourism--total-economic-contribution-worldwide/ & https://www.statista.com/statistics/292479/total-contribution-of-travel-and-tourism-to-gdp-in-selected-countries/\n\nThese datasets detail the contribution of travel to worldwide GDP, along with a future prediction of tourism and travel contributions\nWe also see a breakdown of travel and tourism contributions to GDP for leading travel markets. We plan to pair this data with the inbound tourism expenditures and annual change in GDP to understand whether travel could contribute to changes in GDP.\n\nUNWTO Tourism Contribution to GDP: https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/economic-contribution-SDG\n\nThis site contains data on what percentage of each country’s GDP is contributed by tourism. As with other sources listed above, we can use this data to determine which countries rely more on tourism. We can then pair the data with other sources to understand whether heavily reliant countries are seeing a consistent influx of tourists over time.\n\n\nClimate Conditions:\n\nOur World in Data, Tourism Charts: https://ourworldindata.org/tourism#all-charts\n\nThis site contains data pertaining to per capita CO₂ emissions from commercial aviation, adjusted for tourism, in 2018. While it is not the most current data, we can use this data to understand how travel contributes to CO₂ emissions\n\nIMF Climate-Related Disasters Frequency: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore\n\nThe IMF aggregated the number of climate-related disasters for each country from 1980 to 2022. Paired with information on tourism GDP and tourist influx, we can understand whether changes in tourism coincide with any climate-related events.\n\nBerkeley Earth Global Temperature Data: https://berkeleyearth.org/data/\n\nThe Berkeley Earth database contains average temperatures (highs, lows and true average) by global regions and select countries. We can use this data to get an idea of how temperatures have have fluctuated across regions and whether the fluctuations coincide with climate-related events or changes in tourism.\n\nComparative Climate Change Data in the US: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/comparative-climatic-data\n\nWhile the data in this site is limited to the United States, we can explore data related to temperature and precipitation to understand climate trends in the US.\nWe can also leverage this data to determine if there are coinciding trends between climate and US tourism\n\nWorld Happiness Report: https://worldhappiness.report/data/\n\nWe can explore the various happiness metrics in relation to the GDP per capita provided in the data set and extrapolate any trends to trends in tourism as well. The happiness metrics could give us further insight into which aspects of the country’s infrastructure (i.e. political, social) are most strongly tied to GDP per capita, GDP fluctuations over the year and tourism levels, which would help us answer whether happiness and tourism can be associated with each other.\nThis data could lend itself to PCA, as we can determine how strength of association between happiness factors and can determine where the countries lie in relation to these factors."

This graph shows us how much missing data there is for each country for 2022 inbound arrivals data. To deal with this missing data, we may choose to study only those countries with at least one value in a given year. There is no benefit to including countries who do not report their tourism data in our study.\n\n\nCode\n#subset for total arrivals rather than all arrival types\ntotal_inbound &lt;- subset(inbound_arrivals, inbound_arrivals$Merged_Column ==\"Total arrivals\")\ntotal_inbound$Missing &lt;- is.na(total_inbound$`2022`)\ntotal_inbound$Total_arrival_data_in_2022 &lt;- 1\n\n#manipulate data to show missing values in a given year\nggplot(data = total_inbound, aes(x = Country, y = Total_arrival_data_in_2022, fill=Missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red3\", \"FALSE\" = \"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we just look at total arrivals for inbound arrival data in 2022, we see a lot more values across countries. The data is still quite sparse, so we will still want to study countries only if they have at least one value in the year we are studying, but this suggests that “Total arrivals” could be a better case study than looking at all different types of inbound arrivals.\n\n\n3.3.2 Climate-related Disasters Data\n\n\nCode\nclimate_df &lt;- read.csv(\"data_raw/Climate-related_Disasters_Frequency.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#manipulate data to show missing values in a given year\nclimate_df$Missing &lt;- is.na(climate_df$F2022)\nclimate_df$Data_in_2022 &lt;- 1\n\nggplot(data = climate_df, aes(x = Country, y = Data_in_2022, fill=Missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red3\", \"FALSE\" =\"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate data is also missing a decent amount of data, so we will want to take a similar approach, where we only study those countries with at least one value in the given year. Again, we may want to subset the data to look at a specific severe weather type that may have more values, such as total weather disasters. This missing data can of course be explained by lack of reporting from countries, but it can also be attributed to the fact that many countries may not experience certain severe weather types in any year. For example, temperate countries may not experience extreme temperatures, countries in deserts may not experience floods, etc…\n\n\n3.3.3 GDP Data\n\n\nCode\nGDP_df &lt;- read_excel(\"data_raw/imf-dm-export-20231214.xls\") \n\nGDP_df&lt;-as.data.frame(GDP_df[-1,])\n\nnames(GDP_df)[names(GDP_df)==\"Real GDP growth (Annual percent change)\"] &lt;- \"Country\"\n\nGDP_df &lt;- GDP_df %&gt;%\n  mutate_all(~ ifelse(. == \"no data\", NA, .))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhappiness_df &lt;- read_excel(\"data_raw/DataForFigure2.1WHR2023.xls\")\n\nhappiness_df&lt;-as.data.frame(happiness_df)\n\n\nOur GDP and Happiness data are very well populated.

    "section": "",
    "text": "From our study on tourism, we learned that climate, happiness, and economy are directly related to tourism. These are complex relationships across every country, but it is clear from our analysis that tourism has a positive impact on economy, and tourists flock to countries with less climate disasters and higher perceived happiness. Tourism is a worthwhile investment for a country. It was interesting to study multiple factors when it comes to tourism, not simply how much tourism occurs in each country. We enjoyed studying deeper and looking at impacts on society and climate. It was rewarding to see that most of our hypotheses were correct, and we enjoyed learning about the positives and negatives of tourism.\nWith only ten visuals, our study was limited. There were many relationships that we could have studied that were beyond the scope of this project. It was difficult to choose which variables to study, but we decided to cover a small portion of each area of interest, so that we could cover different aspects of tourism. Because of this, we were not able to dive deep into each subject, but we did enjoy learning a bit about each one. In the future, we would study more type of tourism, not simply inbound arrivals. We would like to analyze different types of travel (personal vs business), more on outbound travel, and more about the tourism industry itself (hotels, restaurants, airports, etc…). We would also like to look more into the effect of tourism on climate, as we were only able to study the impact of climate disasters on tourism. We would like to see whether tourism is a cause of climate change as well. Further, it would be interesting to create a predictive model to measure how many tourists might arrive in each country in coming years. In our interactive plot, we studied tourism contribution to GDP and inbound tourist arrivals from 2019 and 2021. We studied these years as an analysis of post and pre-pandemic travel. We note the large difference in tourism in Malaysia before and after the pandemic. In a larger study, we would like to analyze differences in travel during these years for all countries and regions.\nTourism is a complex topic, especially when involving other variables. However, there are many different angles from which to look at tourism, making it interesting for anyone to study. We learned that tourism is not simply about travel, leisure, or business, but tourism can impact the livelihood of an entire country."

The main shift comes from China, where after 2020, visits drop significantly. Macao and Hong Kong drop off of the list entirely by 2022. China was the most visited country in 2018 and 2019, but is overtaken by Italy in 2020 and then Spain in 2021 and 2022. It is not difficult to see the impact of the corona virus pandemic in this data. Not only with countries visited, but also in the number of travelers. The most visited countries decreased by up to four times between 2019 and 2020. Some recovery in travel began in 2021, but was not notable until 2022, especially in Spain."

Croatia was already seeing almost 40 million arrivals per year in 2000, peaking at 60 million in 2019. Turkey has seen the most growth, starting at 10 million arrivals per year in 2000, and peaking over 50 million in both 2019 and 2022. In fact, Turkey is the only country that has returned to its pre-pandemic level of arrivals. All four countries saw a drastic decrease in arrivals in 2020, with 2020 numbers being the lowest recorded since 2000 for Croatia, Italy, and Spain. Turkey has had more fluctuation in travel numbers since 2017, possibly due to earthquakes as well as Covid. Croatia and Spain had small peaks in 2008, perhaps slowing down in 2009 and 2010 due to the global financial crisis. From the growth before the pandemic, we can expect these countries to continue to see more tourism in the post-pandemic world."

The GDP data spans from 2000 to 2022. From this plot, we can see that China has the highest possible GDP, but has the most spread distribution. All other countries have a fairly similar distribution and median, with Italy and Canada having slightly higher medians than the other seven countries. However, with China’s unique distribution, it is difficult for us to assess the other countries’ GDP.\nWhen we remove China from the plots, we see that Canada and Italy now have the most spread GDP distribution. Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Turkey have fairly spread distributions as well. Each of these countries have a bimodal distribution. This indicates that these countries have had a lot of fluctuation in GDP since 2000. Hungary, Greece, Denmark, and Croatia have more stark modes, but lower median GDPs than the other countries."

For this metric, we only have data up to 2021, but we have seen in previous plots that tourism does not follow usual patterns after the pandemic, so we can safely study trends up to 2020, and assume they were typical for the pre-pandemic world. We can see that China’s region of Macao receives by far the highest percentage of GDP from tourism compared to any other country between 2018 and 2020. Most other countries gaining a large percentage of their GDP from tourism are smaller island nations, such as Guam, Fiji, Jamaica, etc… However, we do see some of the top ten receiving a noteworthy amount of GDP from tourism, namely Croatia, Spain, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. From this, we can conclude that many of the most visited countries do benefit economically from their tourism industries, but many smaller countries that may not be the most visited gain more positive impact on their economies from the tourism they receive."

We will study the top twenty countries in terms of tourism expenditure. In the first heatmap, we can see that the spend on tourism in the United States dwarfs that of almost every country. It is possible that the United States is not noted as one of the most visited countries because, being such a large nation, there is a large amount of tourism within the country, which would not contribute to arrivals. Many other countries see more international arrivals due to their size.\nDespite that, the United States still spends the most money on inbound tourism. We can also see in the heatmap that there was a large decline in tourism expenditure in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19. France and Thailand had somewhat significant spending in 2018 and 2019, with only Frnace returning to tourism spending in 2022.\nWhen we remove the United States from the heatmap, it is easier to see which countries are spending the most on inbound tourism. France spends the most of the remaining countries, with Turkey and Italy investing a great deal in 2022. These two countries have certainly seen the payoff, being two of the top ten visited countries in 2022. Perhaps related to the trend in inbound arrivals, Macao spent a lot more money on tourism in 2018 and 2019 compared to post-pandemic years. An increase in spending since the pandemic has payed off for many countries, as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Greece are in the top twenty on spending and the top ten most visited. Tourism has direct economic impacts, and investing in tourists will benefit a country’s economy as well."

The plots above show the number and types of climate disasters in different regions from 2018-2022. In each of these years, East Asia and Pacific is the region with the most climate disasters, typically followed by Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and Caribbean. As we have seen, the majority of the most visited countries are in Europe and Central Asia, one of the regions with less climate disasters, as well as Saudi Arabia in the middle east, where there are certainly the least climate disasters. Further, in 2018 and 2019 when China dominated the top visited country, there were more cases of extreme temperature in Europe, which have settled since 2020.\nAdditionally, we can confidently assume that the pandemic was the main cause of a decrease in tourism since 2020, but we should also note the increase in climate disasters across the world since 2020 as well. East Asia and Pacific went from 75 climate disasters to over 100 between 2018 and 2020. Latin America and Caribbean jumped from ~42 in 2018 to 75 in 2021. Unfortunately, it is possible that tourism is a cause for these climate disasters."

The United States dominates again, with over 125 disasters in the past five years. We note that there are only two countries in the top ten most visited that are included in the top twenty for climate disasters: China and Italy. Like the United States, China is an enormous, geographically diverse country, so having many climate disasters in these years is not surprising. Italy, however, is much smaller, but we know that Italy is facing many issues with flooding, often tied to tourism, especially in Venice. (https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/venice-floods-problems-intl/index.html)\nOther than Italy and China, we do not see any other top visited countries in the list of most climate disasters, indicating that tourists flock to countries that do not pose climate risks, especially those that may impact travel, such as storms or floods."

Every other country had three or less climate disasters in 2022. The most common disasters in the top visited countries were storms and floods. Two countries, Hungary and Saudi Arabia, did not report any climate disasters in 2022. Further, three of the top visited countries only had one climate disaster in 2022. Clearly, the countries that most tourists visit are not risky countries when it comes to climate change."

From all countries studied, we can see that GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy seem to be linearly related. Economic freedom and support for citizens unsurprisingly lead to a higher life expectancy. Interestingly, there is a negative trend between freedom to make life choices and generosity, meaning countries with higher perceived freedom to make choices report lower scores for generosity, and vice versa. Similarly, there is another negative trend between generosity and perceptions of corruption. Lower generosity generally coincides with higher perceptions of corruption and vice versa. It is important to note that this data comes from polls and is averaged from every poll taken in the country, but it is still interesting to study how different indicators for happiness are generally related. Now we will see how this relates to tourism.\n\n\nCode\ntop_ten_arrivals &lt;- c(\"Spain\",\"Italy\",\"Turkey\",\"Croatia\",\"Hungary\",\"Denmark\",\"Greece\",\"China\",\"Canada\",\"Saudi Arabia\")\n\nhappiness_df &lt;- happiness_df %&gt;%\n  rename(Country_name = `Country name`)\n\nhappy_ten &lt;- subset(happiness_df, Country_name %in% top_ten_arrivals)\n\nlibrary(redav)\nhappiness_data &lt;- happy_ten[,c(1,6:11)]\nhappiness_data &lt;- na.omit(happiness_data)\ndraw_biplot(happiness_data)+\n  labs(title = \"Happiness Indicators in Most Visited Countries\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the PCA chart above, we see how the chosen happiness indicators and related, and which indicators are most important in the top 10 most visited countries. We can see that Denmark and Canada have similar levels for each happiness indicator, with the highest values for generosity, social support, and logged GDP per capita. Greece has the lowest rating for generosity and logged GDP per capita, and the highest for perceptions of corruption. It is very interesting to note that when looking at logged GDP per capita, China is number nine out of ten, compared to having the top GDP in the ridgeline plot above. China also has very little social support and the second lowest health life expectancy, only better than Saudi Arabia. Spain falls somewhat central to most indicators, which is surprising as the most visited country in 2022. Perhaps the lack of extremes attracts visitors."

Croatia was already seeing almost 40 million arrivals per year in 2000, peaking at 60 million in 2019. Turkey has seen the most growth, starting at 10 million arrivals per year in 2000, and peaking over 50 million in both 2019 and 2022. In fact, Turkey is the only country that has returned to its pre-pandemic level of arrivals. All four countries saw a drastic decrease in arrivals in 2020, with 2020 numbers being the lowest recorded since 2000 for Croatia, Italy, and Spain. Turkey has had more fluctuation in travel numbers since 2017, possibly due to earthquakes as well as Covid. Croatia and Spain had small peaks in 2008, perhaps slowing down in 2009 and 2010 due to the global financial crisis. From the growth before the pandemic, we can expect these countries to continue to see more tourism in the post-pandemic world."

The GDP data spans from 2000 to 2022. From this plot, we can see that China has the highest possible GDP, but has the most spread distribution. All other countries have a fairly similar distribution and median, with Italy and Canada having slightly higher medians than the other seven countries. However, with China’s unique distribution, it is difficult for us to assess the other countries’ GDP.\nWhen we remove China from the plots, we see that Canada and Italy now have the most spread GDP distribution. Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Turkey have fairly spread distributions as well. Each of these countries have a bimodal distribution. This indicates that these countries have had a lot of fluctuation in GDP since 2000. Hungary, Greece, Denmark, and Croatia have more stark modes, but lower median GDPs than the other countries.\n\n\n3.2.2 Travel Contribution to GDP from 2018-2021\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(Lock5withR)\n\ntourism_gdp_raw &lt;-read.csv(\"data_raw/tourism_gdp_contribution.csv\")\n\n# Filter data for years 2018-2021.

For this metric, we only have data up to 2021, but we have seen in previous plots that tourism does not follow usual patterns after the pandemic, so we can safely study trends up to 2020, and assume they were typical for the pre-pandemic world. We can see that China’s region of Macao receives by far the highest percentage of GDP from tourism compared to any other country between 2018 and 2020. Most other countries gaining a large percentage of their GDP from tourism are smaller island nations, such as Guam, Fiji, Jamaica, etc… However, we do see some of the top ten receiving a noteworthy amount of GDP from tourism, namely Croatia, Spain, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. From this, we can conclude that many of the most visited countries do benefit economically from their tourism industries, but many smaller countries that may not be the most visited gain more positive impact on their economies from the tourism they receive.\n\n\n3.2.3 Heatmap of Inbound Tourism Expenditure from 2018-2022\n\n\nCode\nsuppressWarnings({\nsuppressMessages(library(magrittr))\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressMessages(library(RColorBrewer))\n\nexpenditures_raw &lt;-read.csv(\"data_raw/Inbound_Expenditure.csv\")\n\n#Remove years before 2017\nremove_columns &lt;- c(\"X2012\", \"X2013\", \"X2014\", \"X2015\", \"X2016\", \"X2017\")\nexpenditures_raw &lt;- select(expenditures_raw, -remove_columns)\n\nexpenditures_raw &lt;- rename(expenditures_raw,\n                      \"Country\" = Basic.data.and.indicators,\n                      \"2018\" = X2018,\n                      \"2019\" = X2019,\n                      \"2020\" = X2020,\n                      \"2021\" = X2021,\n                      \"2022\" = X2022)\n\nexpenditures_raw$`2018`&lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\",expenditures_raw$`2018`))\nexpenditures_raw$`2019` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\",expenditures_raw$`2019`))\nexpenditures_raw$`2020` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\",expenditures_raw$`2020`))\nexpenditures_raw$`2021` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\",expenditures_raw$`2021`))\nexpenditures_raw$`2022` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\",expenditures_raw$`2022`))\n\n#Remove rows with NAs between 2018-2022.

We will study the top twenty countries in terms of tourism expenditure. In the first heatmap, we can see that the spend on tourism in the United States dwarfs that of almost every country. It is possible that the United States is not noted as one of the most visited countries because, being such a large nation, there is a large amount of tourism within the country, which would not contribute to arrivals. Many other countries see more international arrivals due to their size. due to their size.\nDespite that, the United States still spends the most money on inbound tourism. We can also see in the heatmap that there was a large decline in tourism expenditure in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19. France and Thailand had somewhat significant spending in 2018 and 2019, with only France returning to tourism spending in 2022.\nWhen we remove the United States from the heatmap, it is easier to see which countries are spending the most on inbound tourism. France spends the most of the remaining countries, with Turkey and Italy investing a great deal in 2022. These two countries have certainly seen the payoff, being two of the top ten visited countries in 2022. Perhaps related to the trend in inbound arrivals, Macao spent a lot more money on tourism in 2018 and 2019 compared to post-pandemic years. An increase in spending since the pandemic has payed off for many countries, as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Greece are in the top twenty on spending and the top ten most visited. Tourism has direct economic impacts, and investing in tourists will benefit a country’s economy as well."

The plots above show the number and types of climate disasters in different regions from 2018-2022. In each of these years, East Asia and Pacific is the region with the most climate disasters, typically followed by Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and Caribbean. As we have seen, the majority of the most visited countries are in Europe and Central Asia, one of the regions with less climate disasters, as well as Saudi Arabia in the middle east, where there are certainly the least climate disasters. Further, in 2018 and 2019 when China dominated the top visited country, there were more cases of extreme temperature in Europe, which have settled since 2020.\nAdditionally, we can confidently assume that the pandemic was the main cause of a decrease in tourism since 2020, but we should also note the increase in climate disasters across the world since 2020 as well. East Asia and Pacific went from 75 climate disasters to over 100 between 2018 and 2020. Latin America and Caribbean jumped from ~42 in 2018 to 75 in 2021. Unfortunately, it is possible that tourism is a cause for these climate disasters.\n\n\n3.3.2 Top 20 Countries with the most Climate Disasters\n\n\nCode\n# Group by country and calculate the total number of disasters\nclimate_countries_total &lt;- climate_category_subset %&gt;%\n  count(Country, wt = Count) %&gt;%\n  top_n(20, n)\n\nclimate_countries_total %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Country, -n),y=n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",fill = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Top 20 Countries with most Climate Disasters from 2018-2022\") +\n  xlab(\"Countries\") +\n  ylab(\"Climate Disaster Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.95, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking on a more granular level, we can see the countries that have had the most climate disasters since 2018. The United States dominates again, with over 125 disasters in the past five years. We note that there are only two countries in the top ten most visited that are included in the top twenty for climate disasters: China and Italy. Like the United States, China is an enormous, geographically diverse country, so having many climate disasters in these years is not surprising. Italy, however, is much smaller, but we know that Italy is facing many issues with flooding, often tied to tourism, especially in Venice. (https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/venice-floods-problems-intl/index.html)\nOther than Italy and China, we do not see any other top visited countries in the list of most climate disasters, indicating that tourists flock to countries that do not pose climate risks, especially those that may impact travel, such as storms or floods.\n\n\n3.3.3 Climate Disasters from 2022 for Countries with most Arrivals\n\n\nCode\n#Identify top 10 countries\ntop_ten_arrivals_caps &lt;- c(\"SPAIN\",\"ITALY\",\"TÜRKIYE\",\"CROATIA\",\"HUNGARY\",\"DENMARK\",\"GREECE\",\"CHINA\",\"CANADA\",\"SAUDI ARABIA\")\ntop_ten_countries &lt;- subset(total_arrivals_2022, Country %in% top_ten_arrivals_caps)\ntop_ten_countries &lt;- top_ten_countries[, c(1,2,7)]\n\nclimate_countries_arrivals &lt;- tail(top_ten_countries, 10)\n\n# Selecting columns from world_regions to join on\ncountry_codes &lt;- expenditures_raw %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Country, Country.Code)\n \n# Join operation\nsuppressMessages(climate_arrivals_joined &lt;- left_join(climate_countries_arrivals, country_codes))\n\n# Find top 10 countries in Subset Dataframe \ntop_arrivals &lt;- climate_arrivals_joined$Country.Code\n\ndisasters_top10 &lt;- climate_category_subset %&gt;%\n  filter(Code %in% top_arrivals)\n\n#Filtering to only 2022 disasters\ndisasters_top10_2022 &lt;- disasters_top10 %&gt;%\n  filter(Years == 2022)\n\n#Calculate total for the top 10 Countries for 2022 only\n# Group by country and calculate the total number of disasters\ndisasters_2022_total &lt;- disasters_top10_2022 %&gt;%\n  count(Country, wt = Count) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, n)\n\n\n#Stacked Bar Chart to break down disaster type\nggplot(disasters_top10_2022, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Count), y = Count, fill = event_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Climate Disasters for Top Arrival Countries in 2022\", x = \"Country\", y = \"Number of Disasters\", fill = \"Disaster Type\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = color_palette)\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking specifically at the top visited countries, we can see that the country with the most climate disasters in 2022 was China with seven disasters, followed by Canada with six. These are the two largest countries by area of our top ten, so it makes sense that they would have the most climate disasters by their sheer size. Every other country had three or less climate disasters in 2022. The most common disasters in the top visited countries were storms and floods. Two countries, Hungary and Saudi Arabia, did not report any climate disasters in 2022. Further, three of the top visited countries only had one climate disaster in 2022. Clearly, the countries that most tourists visit are not risky countries when it comes to climate change."

From all countries studied, we can see that GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy seem to be linearly related. Economic freedom and support for citizens unsurprisingly lead to a higher life expectancy. Interestingly, there is a negative trend between freedom to make life choices and generosity, meaning countries with higher perceived freedom to make choices report lower scores for generosity, and vice versa. Similarly, there is another negative trend between generosity and perceptions of corruption. Lower generosity generally coincides with higher perceptions of corruption and vice versa. It is important to note that this data comes from polls and is averaged from every poll taken in the country, but it is still interesting to study how different indicators for happiness are generally related. Now we will see how this relates to tourism.\n\n\nCode\ntop_ten_arrivals &lt;- c(\"Spain\",\"Italy\",\"Turkey\",\"Croatia\",\"Hungary\",\"Denmark\",\"Greece\",\"China\",\"Canada\",\"Saudi Arabia\")\n\nhappiness_df &lt;- happiness_df %&gt;%\n  rename(Country_name = `Country name`)\n\nhappy_ten &lt;- subset(happiness_df, Country_name %in% top_ten_arrivals)\n\nlibrary(redav)\nhappiness_data &lt;- happy_ten[,c(1,6:11)]\nhappiness_data &lt;- na.omit(happiness_data)\ndraw_biplot(happiness_data)+\n  labs(title = \"Happiness Indicators in Most Visited Countries\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the PCA chart above, we see how the chosen happiness indicators and related, and which indicators are most important in the top 10 most visited countries. We can see that Denmark and Canada have similar levels for each happiness indicator, with the highest values for generosity, social support, and logged GDP per capita. Greece has the lowest rating for generosity and logged GDP per capita, and the highest for perceptions of corruption. It is very interesting to note that when looking at logged GDP per capita, China is number nine out of ten, compared to having the top GDP in the ridgeline plot above. China also has very little social support and the second lowest health life expectancy, only better than Saudi Arabia. Spain falls somewhat central to most indicators, which is surprising as the most visited country in 2022. Perhaps the lack of extremes attracts visitors."

    "text": "2.1 Tourism Data\n\n2.1.1 Technical Description\nFor our project, we will use data on global tourism and related variables and indicators to study the effect tourism has on countries around the world. The main tourism-specific data that we will be using comes from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We will draw data from their “Tourism Statistics Database”, from which we will use five tables containing tourism indicators for each country. The tables have data for Inbound Tourism, Domestic Tourism, Outbound Tourism, Tourism Industries, and Employment. Inbound, Domestic, and Outbound Tourism tables have data on arrivals, accommodation, expenditure, and departures. We will focus on inbound arrivals and employment. The data provides indicators by country, with values (in thousands) for each indicator from 1995-2022. Countries are listed in the same column as the indicators, with the same indicators for each country following in the rows after the country name. Therefore, to make this data useful for graphing, we will need to do quite a bit of engineering to organize indicators. The data is collected yearly from countries by the UNWTO, with the most recent data update taking place October 2023. However, our data is yearly and thus only goes until 2022, since the full data for 2023 is not yet available. Further, the data requires that each individual country accurately and routinely tracks tourism data and then reports it to the United Nations, and thus there is a large amount of missing data for many countries, especially in earlier years. In fact, the UN did not outline their International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics (IRTS 2008) until 2008, and the World Tourism Organization only became an agency of the UN in 2004, so data was not as regulated before these years.\nTo study the effects that tourism has on the economy, climate, and happiness, we will use supplemental data. For economic factors, we will study employment from the UNWTO data, and will also use data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to analyze the relationship between tourism and GDP. The data is a simple table where rows are countries, columns are the years from 1980 to 2028, with data from 2023 to 2028 being projected values.The values in the table represent actual GDP values for each country and year. The data comes from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook report, which is updated yearly. The data mapper from which we are pulling data only includes some indicators from the entire report. Data is collected as accurately as possible by IMF employees, and historical data is updated as more information becomes available. Though the employees of IMF gather data as meticulously as possible, of course there are still gaps. Similarly to tourism data, much of the data is missing in earlier years. Our downloaded data was updated October 2023.\nOur climate data also comes from the International Monetary Fund, from their Climate Change Dashboard, which offers global data on many climate change indicators. We will be studying Climate-related Disasters data. This data is organized similarly to the GDP data, with rows being for countries and columns for years 1980-2022. The values in the table indicate the number of climate-related disasters that occurred in each country for each year. Each country has multiple rows, since for each there is a row for drought, temperature, flood, wildfire, storm, landslide, and total. The data was last updated in April 2023, but data is updated when there is availability of new indicators or methodology, which does not have a set schedule. Again, similar to GDP, data is collected and released by IMF employees to the best of their ability.\nFinally, we will use happiness data from the World Happiness Report, which gathers data from the Gallup World Poll surveys from 2020 to 2022. Unfortunately, the average sample size from the poll is 1,000 people per country, and thus the data is far from conclusive. However, the data offers multiple “happiness indicators” from the poll for any participating countries. Some examples are Social support data, a Healthy Life score, a value for “Freedom to make life choices”, and more. Data is quantitative, using an average score from the Gallup poll. The report has been released most years since 2012, but we will focus on the most recent report, with data from the 2023 Gallup poll.\nFor all data, we will download excel or csv files and read them as data frames. The indicator data (economy, climate, happiness) will not need much engineering beyond missing values. UNWTO data will need to be pivoted. Then, data will be joined by country name to conduct our analysis and create graphs.\n\n\n2.1.2 Research Plan\nBased on our multi-faceted approach to understanding tourism, we plan to use the following data sources to answer our research questions:\nTourism by Country:\n\nUNWTO Statistics: https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/key-tourism-statistics\n\nThis dataset contains information on inbound, domestic and outbound tourism for countries around the world\nFor inbound tourism, UNWTO provides data on travel purpose, mode of transportation, traveler accommodations, and tourism expenditure\nThe dataset also contains expenditure information for domestic and outbound travels\nWe will use this data to identify trends in inbound travel across countries and larger regions. Visualizing the inbound expenditures data, especially, enables us to understand how much tourists contribute to local economies at a high level\n\n\nTourism and the Economy:\n\nIMF GDP Growth: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD\nThis dataset captures the actual GDP value (in billions) for all countries from 1980 through 2023, with predictions until 2028. We can use the dataset to identify the overall trend in GDP across countries, as a baseline for understanding how tourism may factor into it.\n\nWe envision plotting this data to study how tourism effects GDP and whether richer countries see more tourism.\n\nStatista Travel GDP Contributions: https://www.statista.com/statistics/233223/travel-and-tourism--total-economic-contribution-worldwide/ & https://www.statista.com/statistics/292479/total-contribution-of-travel-and-tourism-to-gdp-in-selected-countries/\n\nThese datasets detail the contribution of travel to worldwide GDP, along with a future prediction of tourism and travel contributions\nWe also see a breakdown of travel and tourism contributions to GDP for leading travel markets. We plan to pair this data with the inbound tourism expenditures and annual change in GDP to understand whether travel could contribute to changes in GDP.\n\nUNWTO Tourism Contribution to GDP: https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/economic-contribution-SDG\n\nThis site contains data on what percentage of each country’s GDP is contributed by tourism. As with other sources listed above, we can use this data to determine which countries rely more on tourism. We can then pair the data with other sources to understand whether heavily reliant countries are seeing a consistent influx of tourists over time.\n\n\nClimate Conditions:\n\nOur World in Data, Tourism Charts: https://ourworldindata.org/tourism#all-charts\n\nThis site contains data pertaining to per capita CO₂ emissions from commercial aviation, adjusted for tourism, in 2018. While it is not the most current data, we can use this data to understand how travel contributes to CO₂ emissions\n\nIMF Climate-Related Disasters Frequency: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore\n\nThe IMF aggregated the number of climate-related disasters for each country from 1980 to 2022. Paired with information on tourism GDP and tourist influx, we can understand whether changes in tourism coincide with any climate-related events.\n\nBerkeley Earth Global Temperature Data: https://berkeleyearth.org/data/\n\nThe Berkeley Earth database contains average temperatures (highs, lows and true average) by global regions and select countries. We can use this data to get an idea of how temperatures have have fluctuated across regions and whether the fluctuations coincide with climate-related events or changes in tourism.\n\nComparative Climate Change Data in the US: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/comparative-climatic-data\n\nWhile the data in this site is limited to the United States, we can explore data related to temperature and precipitation to understand climate trends in the US.\nWe can also leverage this data to determine if there are coinciding trends between climate and US tourism\n\nWorld Happiness Report: https://worldhappiness.report/data/\n\nWe can explore the various happiness metrics in relation to the GDP per capita provided in the data set and extrapolate any trends to trends in tourism as well. The happiness metrics could give us further insight into which aspects of the country’s infrastructure (i.e. political, social) are most strongly tied to GDP per capita, GDP fluctuations over the year and tourism levels, which would help us answer whether happiness and tourism can be associated with each other.\nThis data could lend itself to PCA, as we can determine how strength of association between happiness factors and can determine where the countries lie in relation to these factors.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Missing value analysis\n\n2.1.3.1 UNWTO Tourism Data\n\n\nCode\n#Read data from excel\n#install.packages(\"readxl\")\n\nsuppressMessages(library(readxl))\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyr))\nsuppressMessages(library(dplyr))\n\nsuppressMessages(sheet_names &lt;- excel_sheets(\"data_raw/unwto-all-data-download_102023.xlsx\"))\n\n#create a data frame for each sheet and store them in all_dfs\nsuppressMessages(all_dfs &lt;- lapply(sheet_names, function(sheet) {\n  read_excel(\"data_raw/unwto-all-data-download_102023.xlsx\", sheet = sheet)\n}))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#access the desired dataframe from all_dfs\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- as.data.frame(all_dfs[2])\n\n#Cleaning up the data set to remove unnecessary rows and columns, and rename/change type of columns\ncols_to_del = c(-1,-2,-3)\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals[,cols_to_del]\n\ncol_names &lt;- inbound_arrivals[2, ]\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals[-2, ]\n\ncolnames(inbound_arrivals) &lt;- col_names\n\nnames(inbound_arrivals)[names(inbound_arrivals)==\"Basic data and indicators\"] &lt;- \"Country\"\n\nnames(inbound_arrivals)[2:5] &lt;- c(\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\")\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals[-1,-37]\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals %&gt;%\n  mutate_all(~ ifelse(. == \"..\", NA, .))\n\ncolumns_indices_to_convert &lt;- 10:36\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(columns_indices_to_convert, as.numeric)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Replace empty rows for country with the last non-empty value until a new value appears\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals %&gt;%\n  fill(\"Country\")\n\n#Merging arrival types into one column\ncolumns_to_merge &lt;- c(\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\") \n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals %&gt;%\n  mutate(Merged_Column = coalesce(!!!syms(columns_to_merge)))\n\ncolumn_names &lt;- names(inbound_arrivals)\n\n#moving the merged column to the front of the dataframe\nlast_column &lt;- column_names[length(column_names)]\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals[, !names(inbound_arrivals) %in% columns_to_merge]\n\ncolumn_to_move &lt;- \"Merged_Column\"\nnew_position &lt;- 2\n\ninbound_arrivals &lt;- inbound_arrivals %&gt;%\n  select(-{{column_to_move}}) %&gt;%\n  mutate({{column_to_move}} := inbound_arrivals[[column_to_move]]) %&gt;%\n  select({{column_to_move}}, everything())\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n#manipulate data to show missing values in a given year\ninbound_arrivals$Missing &lt;- is.na(inbound_arrivals$`2022`)\ninbound_arrivals$Data_in_2022 &lt;- 1\n\nggplot(data = inbound_arrivals, aes(x = Country, y = Data_in_2022, fill=Missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red3\", \"FALSE\" = \"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Data\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from UNWTO is quite sparse, as we can see in the plot above. This graph shows us how much missing data there is for each country for 2022 inbound arrivals data. To deal with this missing data, we may choose to study only those countries with at least one value in a given year. There is no benefit to including countries who do not report their tourism data in our study.\n\n\nCode\n#subset for total arrivals rather than all arrival types\ntotal_inbound &lt;- subset(inbound_arrivals, inbound_arrivals$Merged_Column ==\"Total arrivals\")\ntotal_inbound$Missing &lt;- is.na(total_inbound$`2022`)\ntotal_inbound$Total_arrival_data_in_2022 &lt;- 1\n\n#manipulate data to show missing values in a given year\nggplot(data = total_inbound, aes(x = Country, y = Total_arrival_data_in_2022, fill=Missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red3\", \"FALSE\" = \"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we just look at total arrivals for inbound arrival data in 2022, we see a lot more values across countries. The data is still quite sparse, so we will still want to study countries only if they have at least one value in the year we are studying, but this suggests that “Total arrivals” could be a better case study than looking at all different types of inbound arrivals.\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Climate-related Disasters Data\n\n\nCode\nclimate_df &lt;- read.csv(\"data_raw/Climate-related_Disasters_Frequency.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#manipulate data to show missing values in a given year\nclimate_df$Missing &lt;- is.na(climate_df$F2022)\nclimate_df$Data_in_2022 &lt;- 1\n\nggplot(data = climate_df, aes(x = Country, y = Data_in_2022, fill=Missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red3\", \"FALSE\" =\"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate data is also missing a decent amount of data, so we will want to take a similar approach, where we only study those countries with at least one value in the given year. Again, we may want to subset the data to look at a specific severe weather type that may have more values, such as total weather disasters. This missing data can of course be explained by lack of reporting from countries, but it can also be attributed to the fact that many countries may not experience certain severe weather types in any year. For example, temperate countries may not experience extreme temperatures, countries in deserts may not experience floods, etc…\n\n\n2.1.3.3 GDP and Happiness Data\n\n\nCode\nGDP_df &lt;- read_excel(\"data_raw/imf-dm-export-20231214.xls\") \n\nGDP_df&lt;-as.data.frame(GDP_df[-1,])\n\nnames(GDP_df)[names(GDP_df)==\"Real GDP growth (Annual percent change)\"] &lt;- \"Country\"\n\nGDP_df &lt;- GDP_df %&gt;%\n  mutate_all(~ ifelse(. == \"no data\", NA, .))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhappiness_df &lt;- read_excel(\"data_raw/DataForFigure2.1WHR2023.xls\")\n\nhappiness_df&lt;-as.data.frame(happiness_df)\n\n\nOur GDP and Happiness data are very well populated. GDP is particularly well documented in later years. The happiness study only draws from countries who respond to the survey, and values are averages across those countries, so there is no missing data."
