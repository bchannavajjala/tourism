    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe objective of this project is to explore the intricate relationship between tourism and economic indicators and climate conditions. We begin the exploration by assessing the significance of tourism in each country by examining domestic, inbound and outbound tourism coupled with tourist expenditure for each of these categories. Once we understand trends in global tourism, our focus shifts to how tourism factors into global economies.\nTourism plays a pivotal role in many countries, especially in those with tropical climates. For example, in 2019, it was reported that tourism contributed to over 30% of the GDP for Macau, Maldives and Aruba. In studying how travel factors into GDP globally, we aim to identify seasonal and geographical trends. This includes the impact of significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the global travel economy. We also hope to discern emerging travel corridors resulting from re-opening borders or economic stimulation. Our investigation also extends to metrics such as employment, which are also markers of economic health for the tourism industry.\nThe surge of large climate events such as heat waves, floods and forest fires around the world, also prompts us to consider how tourism and climate are intertwined. In examining air travel alone, we can observe the carbon footprint of travel. We’re also interested in understanding how natural disasters and evolving climate conditions may have affected popular tourist destinations.\nOur motivation for choosing this topic stems from our interest in creating and exploring maps. The study of tourism metrics visually aligns well with maps, as we can easily identify regional differences and global, cyclical trends. The steep decline in travel during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic spurred our curiosity about the resurgence of the tourism. To this end, we want to understand whether economic and climate conditions are conducive to tourism and vice-versa."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nBased on our multi-faceted approach to understanding tourism, we plan to use the following data sources to answer our research questions:\nTourism by Country:\n\nUNWTO Statistics: https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/key-tourism-statistics\n\nThis dataset contains information on inbound, domestic and outbound tourism for countries around the world\nFor inbound tourism, UNWTO provides data on travel purpose, mode of transportation, traveler accommodations, and tourism expenditure\nThe dataset also contains expenditure information for domestic and outbound travels\nWe will use this data to identify trends in inbound, domestic and outbound travel across countries and larger regions. Visualizing the inbound expenditures data, especially, enables us to understand how much tourists contribute to local economies at a high level\n\n\nTourism and the Economy:\n\nIMF GDP Growth: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD\n\nThis dataset captures the annual percent change in GDP for all countries from 1980 through 2023, with predictions until 2028. We can use the dataset to identify the overall trend in GDP across countries, as a baseline for understanding how tourism may factor into it.\n\nStatista Travel GDP Contributions: https://www.statista.com/statistics/233223/travel-and-tourism--total-economic-contribution-worldwide/ & https://www.statista.com/statistics/292479/total-contribution-of-travel-and-tourism-to-gdp-in-selected-countries/\n\nThese datasets detail the contribution of travel to worldwide GDP, along with a future prediction of tourism and travel contributions\nWe also see a breakdown of travel and tourism contributions to GDP for leading travel markets. We plan to pair this data with the inbound tourism expenditures and annual change in GDP to understand whether travel could contribute to changes in GDP.\n\nUNWTO Tourism Contribution to GDP: https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/economic-contribution-SDG\n\nThis site contains data on what percentage of each country’s GDP is contributed by tourism. As with other sources listed above, we can use this data to determine which countries rely more on tourism. We can then pair the data with other sources to understand whether heavily reliant countries are seeing a consistent influx of tourists over time.\n\n\nClimate Conditions:\n\nOur World in Data, Tourism Charts: https://ourworldindata.org/tourism#all-charts\n\nThis site contains data pertaining to per capita CO₂ emissions from commercial aviation, adjusted for tourism, in 2018. While it is not the most current data, we can use this data to understand how travel contributes to CO₂ emissions\n\nIMF Climate-Related Disasters Frequency: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore\n\nThe IMF aggregated the number of climate-related disasters for each country from 1980 to 2022. Paired with information on tourism GDP and tourist influx, we can understand whether changes in tourism coincide with any climate-related events.\n\nBerkeley Earth Global Temperature Data: https://berkeleyearth.org/data/\n\nThe Berkeley Earth database contains average temperatures (highs, lows and true average) by global regions and select countries. We can use this data to get an idea of how temperatures have have fluctuated across regions and whether the fluctuations coincide with climate-related events or changes in tourism.\n\nComparative Climate Change Data in the US: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/comparative-climatic-data\n\nWhile the data in this site is limited to the United States, we can explore data related to temperature and precipitation to understand climate trends in the US.\nWe can also leverage this data to determine if there are coinciding trends between climate and US tourism"
