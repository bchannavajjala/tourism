This project analyzes international trousim, and its relationship with employment, climate, happiness, and economy. 
We use data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Happiness Report from Gallup polls.
The study looks at tourism across the world and how that tourism has evolved over time, shaping infrastructure and other systems.
