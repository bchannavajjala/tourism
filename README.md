This project analyzes international tourism, and its relationship with the economy, climate, employment, and population happiness. 
We use data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Happiness Report from Gallup polls.
The study looks at tourism across the world and how that tourism has evolved over time, shaping infrastructure and other systems.
